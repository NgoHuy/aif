* process and fix libraries
* fix to use $var_UI_TYPE where needed
* write the ui functions for asking questions etc for both cli and dialog,
and port all code to use it. 
* instead of using the 'base' profile and letting other profiles override,
  we should have even more flexibilty to take parts from different profiles.
* fix crossconcerns: some procedures could be about _what_ (desktop,server),
  others are about _how_ (autodetection, asking user,...) (profile vs...
  'mode' ?)
* make some sensible default profiles (eg desktop, server, ...)
* make it work
* someday.. make a script '/arch/setup' that calls '/arch/fifa.sh interactive'
