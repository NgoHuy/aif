* process and fix libraries
* fix to use $var_UI_TYPE where needed
* write the ui functions for asking questions etc for both cli and dialog and port all code to use it. 
* instead of using the 'base' profile and letting other profiles override,
  we should have even more flexibilty to take parts from different profiles.
  eg dieter profile maybe wants to use something interactive. or base
  profile wants to do something interactive. interactive functions maybe
  dont belong in a profile?

* base profile idea: it should just tell you what to do? -> less
  implementation work in base profile, more in other profiles...
* fix crossconcerns: some procedures could be about _what_ (desktop,server),
  others are about _how_ (autodetection, asking user,...) (profile vs...
  'mode' ?)
* port classic installer so it works with fifa
* make some sensible default profiles (eg desktop, server, ...)
* make it work
* someday.. make a script '/arch/setup' that calls '/arch/fifa.sh interactive'
