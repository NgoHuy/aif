### for unmodified install cd: (TODO: someday, have an iso that has the scripts already) ###

You can copy-paste the code below when logged in to the install cd


/arch/setup. # fake ftp install so it lets you run the network configure script
# when network works, quit installer
pacman -Sy git # You need about 192MB ram for this! 128MB is not enough.
git clone git://github.com/Dieterbe/fifa.git /home/arch/tmp
/home/arch/tmp/src/patch-install-cd.sh            # for an 'official' fifa installation
/home/arch/tmp/src/patch-install-cd.sh unoffocial # for a fifa installation including Dieter's custom, unofficial modules
/arch/fifa.sh <procedurename> #you can skip networking.  See readme on howto specify procedures
