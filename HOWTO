### This howto explains how to install aif on an installcd that does not have the aif package installed yet ###
### You can also use this if you want to use another version than what's available on the installcd) ###
### TODO: someday, have an iso that comes with aif by default) ###


1) Boot from the installcd

2) Open 2 shells, one as user root, one as regular user (arch)

3) Decide on a package.  See http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?K=aif for available packages
- aif-git: latest code from the git master (stable) branch: recommended!
- aif-experimental-git: latest development code.  Code is tested here and if ok, merged into master.  Use at own risk!!
I assume you'll pick aif-git.

4) Copy paste the code below.

# root shell:
/arch/setup. # fake ftp install so it lets you run the network configure script
# when network works, quit installer
pacman -Sy git fakeroot # You need about 192MB ram for this! 128MB is not enough.

# arch shell
wget http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aif-git/aif-git.tar.gz
tar -xzf
cd aif-git
makepkg

# root shell:
pacman -U /home/arch/aif-git/aif*.pkg.tar.gz


4) Fire it up! (as root)

/arch/aif -p <procedurename> #you can skip networking.

For more info see README or /arch/aif -h.
