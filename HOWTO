### This howto explains how to install/upgrade aif on an arch system / arch installation cd ###

* an installation cd is in essence just an arch system, it just has the aif package installed. you can install aif on any system without problems.
* install cd's from 2009.02 and up have aif on board, so probably you don't need to do anything at all.

There are 3 aif packages available:
> supported:
  * aif (extra repo): "binary" package, containing latest stable release. this is used by default on the official arch media
> unsupported: there are 2 source packages in AUR, one for each branch in git.  ( see http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?K=aif )
  * aif-git: latest code from the git master (stable) branch: recommended for power users.
  * aif-experimental-git: latest development code.  Code is tested here and if ok, merged into master.  Use at own risk!!



So, if you want to upgrade the aif package on an installation cd..

> aif package from extra:
  ----------------------
  * pacman -Sy aif



> aif git package from AUR: (for example aif-experimental-git. aif-git is the same procedure)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Boot from the installcd

2) Open 2 shells, one as user root, one as regular user (arch)

3) Execute the code below.

# root shell:
aif -p partial-configure-network # if you have a recent enough aif version installed that comes with this procedure.
/arch/setup. # alternatively, use the old installer.  fake ftp install so it lets you run the network configure script, then exit the installer

pacman -Sy git fakeroot # You need about 192MB ram for this! 128MB is not enough.

# arch shell
wget http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aif-experimental-git/aif-experimental-git.tar.gz
tar -xzf aif-experimental-git.tar.gz
cd aif-experimental-git
makepkg

# root shell:
pacman -R aif # pacman can't replace with -U yet..
pacman -U /home/arch/aif-experimental-git/aif*.pkg.tar.gz

4) Fire it up! (as root)

aif -p <procedurename> #you can skip networking.


Notes:
* For more info see README or aif -h.
* Since you configured the network before starting aif, you need to reconfigure it in aif if you want the 'auto-update rc.conf' functionality.
