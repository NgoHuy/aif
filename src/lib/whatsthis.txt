This directory contains several useful functions and scripts, ready to be
used by fifa and it's profiles.

Right now, all this code is taken (and modified) from the 'real' arch linux install scripts
code. (/arch/setup and /arch/quickinst). the modifications are mostly done
to make the code more useable and to separate backend code from the user
interface (which was tightly coupled in the original scripts)


I couldn't find what license the code is under, but I assume this
is okay.. if not let me know.
The original code is at http://projects.archlinux.org/?p=installer.git;a=summary

Later on, maybe other code can be put here too.
