This directory contains several useful functions and scripts, ready to be
used by fifa and it's profiles.

Most of this code is taken (and modified) from the 'real' arch linux install scripts
code. (/arch/setup and /arch/quickinst). the modifications are mostly done
to make the code more useable and to separate backend code from the user
interface (which was tightly coupled in the original scripts)


I couldn't find what license the code is under, but I assume this
is okay.. if not let me know.
The original code is at http://projects.archlinux.org/?p=installer.git;a=summary

I also wrote a few functions myself that I didn't find in the official
scripts (mostly separate ui functions)
