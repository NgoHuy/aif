this is a library-ized version of the 'real' arch linux install scripts
code. (/arch/setup and /arch/quickinst)
I took the code from git, and just split it up in files and functions so it's more
reusable.  I couldn't find what license the code is under, but I assume this
is okay.. if not let me know.
