** Goals **
The goal of this project is 
1) to allow you to install Arch Linux in more flexible and powerful ways.
2) write an automated (unattended) installer
3) Apply DRY patterns to the installation procedure, making it more easy to maintain the code.


You can choose to use unattended (automatic) installation (you can write different profiles for different scenario's,
and/or use autodetection) or prompt the user for whatever you want to know (you could mimic the official installer like
that).
You can also take parts from different profiles (installation procedures) and combine them
together to come up with the installation procedure of your liking.


** File locations (on the install CD): **
* fifa.sh -> /arch/fifa.sh (together with the default installer scripts)
* libraries -> /home/arch/fifa/lib
* docs -> /home/arch/fifa/docs
* all other files (profiles, package lists, ...) used by/for this script -> /home/arch/fifa
